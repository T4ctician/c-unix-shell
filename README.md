# c-unix-shell
Custom UNIX Shell in C

Project Description
This project is a custom shell implementation in C, designed to mimic the behavior of the Bash shell (excluding the prompt style). The shell can handle:

At least 100 commands
At least 1000 arguments per command
 
It remains robust under signals such as CTRL-C, CTRL- \ , and CTRL-Z, ensuring the shell does not terminate unexpectedly. The implementation avoids calling or relying on other existing shells to remain fully independent.
